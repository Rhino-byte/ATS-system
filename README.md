# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) with Generative AI


## 📄 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** powered by **Generative AI (GenAI)** models. The system leverages AI capabilities to streamline recruitment processes by:

- Matching candidates to job roles.
- Automating candidate communication.
- Advising on the chances that the resume provided fits the job description.
- Provides strengths and weakness of a resume in relation to a job description. 

By integrating GenAI, the ATS provides smarter, faster, and more accurate talent acquisition workflows.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Resume Parsing:** Extracts key details such as name, skills, work history, and education from resumes in PDF or DOCX format.
- **Job Description Generation:** Leverages Generative AI to craft precise and engaging job descriptions for any role.
                                 Candidate Matching: Analyzes candidate profiles and job descriptions to compute compatibility scores.
- **Fit Assessment:** Provides a detailed analysis of how well a resume matches a job description and advises on overall fit chances.
                      Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis: Highlights the strengths and areas for improvement in a candidate's resume relative to a job description.
- **Automated Communication:** Drafts customized emails for candidate updates, interview invitations, or feedback.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Streamlit (for the UI)
- **AI Models**: GenAI GPT models (e.g., gemini-1.5)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation.
  - `streamlit` - User interface.
  - `genai` - API integration for GenAI.
  - `pdf2image` - Load in a pdf and convert to image

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- GenAI API key (for GPT model usage)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ATS-system.git
   cd ATS-system
   ```
2. Load in the environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -f environment.yml
   ```
3. Set up the GenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory.
